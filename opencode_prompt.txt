This project is a luxury fragrance brand site (Nocturne Atelier). There are two problems on the home page product grid (Featured Collections):

Clicking “Add to Cart” from the home page doesn’t work.

Product images are missing (cards show 400×400 placeholders instead of real images).

Please fix both issues without changing the current layout or design style.

1. Fix “Add to Cart” from the home page

For each product card in the Featured Collections / home page grid:

Make sure the Add to Cart button (or the cart icon / CTA used on that card) actually:

Calls the same cart logic used on the product details page.

Adds the correct product variant (default size / base variant) to the cart.

Updates the cart state (cart icon in header, mini-cart, etc.).

If the site uses a global cart store (e.g. CartContext, Redux, Zustand, or a cart API):

Ensure the home page is wired to that same store and not using a disconnected stub.

After clicking Add to Cart from the home page:

The product must appear in the cart with the correct:

Name

Price

Quantity (default 1)

Variant/size (use default or the first available option).

Show a small, non-intrusive confirmation:

e.g. toast “Added Aurora No. 1 to cart” or open the mini-cart.

Handle errors gracefully:

If the add-to-cart request fails, show a clear message:

“We couldn’t add this to your cart. Please try again.”

2. Fix missing product images on home page cards

Each product card currently shows a grey “400 × 400” placeholder instead of a real product image.

Do the following:

Ensure each product card pulls its image from the correct data source (CMS / product API), e.g. product.image, product.thumbnail, or product.featuredImage.

If products already have image URLs in the data:

Bind those URLs to the <img> tag (or equivalent image component) on the card.

Make sure the component uses proper alt text (e.g. the product name).

If some products do not yet have an image:

Use a default brand-consistent fallback image (e.g. a neutral bottle silhouette) instead of the grey “400 × 400” placeholder.

Ensure images are:

Correctly sized (square 400×400 or responsive equivalent),

Optimized (no layout shift, object-fit: cover),

Loaded lazily if needed for performance.

3. Keep existing design & structure

Do not change:

The layout of the Featured Collections section,

Typography,

Card spacing,

Button styles,

Navigation.

Only fix:

The add-to-cart functionality from the home page,

The product image binding and fallbacks.

4. Final checks

After implementing:

From the home page, click Add to Cart on several different products:

Verify they appear in the cart with correct name, price, and quantity.

Refresh the home page:

All product cards in Featured Collections should display either their proper product image or a branded fallback, never the raw grey placeholder.

Implement these changes so that home page shopping works smoothly and the product grid looks complete and professional.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "This project is a luxury fragrance brand site (Nocturne Atelier). There are two problems on the home page product grid (Featured Collections):
